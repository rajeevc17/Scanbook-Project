Features:


There is a web responsive design page where the user can enter the ISBN for a book.
The ISBN is used to lookup book Title, Author, Number of pages using https://developers.google.com/books/ API.
There is a way for the user to indicate they have or have not read the book.
A comments section allows the user to provide comments on the book.
All information is entered and presented on a single web page.
If the ISBN already exists in the database then return the stored information instead of looking it up using the Google book API.
The web page makes asynchronous calls to a back-end server to populate the web page.
